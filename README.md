Image Processing in MATLAB: A Comprehensive Course

Welcome to the Image Processing in MATLAB course repository. This collection of scripts and tutorials is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of various image processing techniques using MATLAB. Each file in this repository demonstrates specific image manipulation and enhancement methods, allowing you to experiment and apply these techniques to your own projects.

 Course Contents

Below is a list of topics covered in this course, with each script focusing on a specific aspect of image processing:

1. Image Info and Metadata  
   - Learn how to extract and display basic image information and metadata.

2. Image Resizing  
   - Explore different techniques to resize images while maintaining quality.

3. Edge Detection  
   - Implement algorithms to detect edges in images for feature extraction.

4. Image Cropping  
   - Understand how to crop images effectively, focusing on specific areas of interest.

5. Image Rotation  
   - Learn how to rotate images at various angles and correct orientation.

6. Smoothing and Sharpening  
   - Apply filters to smooth or sharpen images to enhance visual quality.

7. Gaussian and Laplacian Filters  
   - Use Gaussian and Laplacian filters for noise reduction and edge enhancement.

8. Histogram Equalization  
   - Equalize the histogram of an image to improve contrast.

9. Cumulative Distribution Function  
   - Understand and apply the CDF in image enhancement for better visualization.

10. Channel Manipulation and Grayscale Representation  
    - Manipulate color channels and convert images to grayscale for different processing tasks.

11. Color Channel Enhancement  
    - Enhance specific color channels to highlight or suppress features in an image.

12. Image Blending (Merging)  
    - Learn how to blend two or more images to create composite visuals.

13. Thresholding and Binarizing  
    - Perform image thresholding to convert grayscale images to binary format.

14. Erosion and Dilation  
    - Apply morphological operations such as erosion and dilation to refine image shapes.

15. Morphological Operations  
    - Further explore advanced morphological transformations for image analysis.

 Usage

To use the files in this repository, you will need MATLAB installed on your machine. Each script is self-contained and comes with comments to explain the process and parameters used.

1. Download or clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Open the MATLAB scripts in your MATLAB environment and run them directly to see the results and modify them as per your requirements.
