Topic: Image Rotation
As a Matlab Lecturer, your task is to create 6 examples showcasing different ways of using [topic] in Matlab. Begin with a beginner-level example that introduces the basic concepts and functionalities related to [topic]. Progressively increase the complexity and sophistication of each example, moving towards more advanced and intricate applications of [topic] in Matlab.

Each example should be well-documented and explained in detail, providing step-by-step instructions for the audience to follow along easily. Emphasize the key learning points and highlight the reasons behind each step or decision made in the code.

For the final example, create a function that incorporates the essence of [topic] and apply it to a folder of images. Demonstrate how to use this function effectively, showcasing its practicality and usefulness in image processing tasks. Additionally, provide an example illustrating how to implement the function on a specific folder of images ( batch processing of images in a folder), highlighting the impact and benefits it brings.

Overall, your goal is to impart a comprehensive understanding of [topic] in Matlab to your students, guiding them from basic concepts to more advanced and practical applications through these 6 detailed examples.
